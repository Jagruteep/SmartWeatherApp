# SmartWeatherApp

• Developed a web application that takes city name as an input and gives weather updates such as temperature, latitude, longitude and other relevant details.

• Used APIs to fetch the weather updates according to the city name.

• I developed this application with Visual Studio using JavaScript, Node.js , express.js, require, request module, HTML, CSS, Google font styles and deployed on Heroku platform.
